<h3>Long Bio</h3>
<p>Nicole Edmond is a 22-year-old student living in New York City with a passion for video editing, media, and film. She’s interested in how media influences how we experience the world. She’s currently studying media studies, where she’s focused on exploring storytelling, technology, and culture. Nicole is especially fascinated by how media shapes perception, how the images we see, the content we scroll through, and the platforms we use all contribute to the way we understand ourselves and the world around us. Beyond her academic and creative interests, Nicole also loves music. Her favorite artists and bands include The Lumineers, Morgan Wallen, Turnstile, Arctic Monkeys, Sam Barber, and Bob Dylan. Music often serves as inspiration for her edits and plays a big part in how she connects emotionally to what she creates. She’s very excited to be learning more about web production since it’s something she didn’t do much of in the past.
