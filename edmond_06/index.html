            <section>Pizza. Classic and customizable. Nothing beats a good slice of bread and cheese.</section>
            <section>Sushi. My favorite is a salmon avacado roll and crispy rice. Fresh, light, and full of flavor.</section>
            <section>Tacos. Street-style or fully loaded, tacos are always a good idea.</section>
            <section>Pasta. Comfort food at its finest. Spaghetti, pappardelle, capellini, fettuccine...I'll have them all. </section>
            <section>Pancakes. Fluffy breakfast essential. Best with butter, syrup, and maybe some fresh fruit.</section>
            <section>Mac and Cheese. Warm, cheesy, and nostalgic. Nothing compares.</section>
            <section>Ramen. Flavor-packed broth, noodles, and toppings, what's not to love.</section>
            <section>Quinoa Bowl. High in protein and gluten-free. Love to pair this with chicken or steak and top it with veggies and a light dressing.</section>
            <section>Grilled Salmon. Rich in omega-3's, great for brain and heart health.</section>
            <section>Greek Yogurt. Packed with probiotics and antioxidants. A drizzle of honey and some chia seeds spice this up. </section>
            <section>Empanadas. My favorite is filled with meat and potatoes. </section>
            <section>Chocolate Chip Cookies. Can't forget dessert. Homemade is the best.</section>
