        <h2>Spring</h2>
        <p>Spring marks the transition from winter’s dormancy to warmer days and renewed life. In many regions, it spans March to May in the Northern Hemisphere. The term originates from Old English “springan”, meaning “to leap or burst forth,” reflecting how nature awakens with budding trees and blooming flowers. This period is also tied to cultural traditions like the vernal equinox, which many societies once celebrated as the moment when day and night achieve balance, symbolizing fertility and rebirth. </p>
        <p>Culturally, spring is often linked to themes of renewal: for instance, Easter has roots in older fertility rites such as the Celtic festival of Ostara, which celebrated new life with symbols like eggs and rabbits. Today, many communities mark the season with garden fairs, farmers’ markets, and “spring cleaning,” echoing ancient practices of preparing both homes and fields for new growth.</p>

        <h2>Summer</h2>
        <p>Summer, typically spanning June to August, is known for long, sunlit days and warm temperatures. In the U.S., the tradition is to mark summer from Memorial Day to Labor Day, coinciding with the meteorological summer season. The summer solstice, the year’s longest day, was historically commemorated around 21–22 June with festivals and bonfires in ancient Europe and China to honor the sun’s peak. </p>
        <p>This season also saw the rise of leisure traditions in the late 19th century, school holidays, seaside resorts, barbecues, state fairs, and fireworks became hallmarks of what we now think of as a classic summer experience. </p>
       
        <h2>Fall</h2>
        <p>Autumn, falling between September and November in the Northern Hemisphere, is characterized by cooling temperatures and vibrant foliage. Its name has deep agricultural roots, a time when crops are harvested and food preserved. Historically, festivals like Lammas welcomed the first wheat and bread of the season, and Thanksgiving evolved in North America to celebrate communal gratitude for the harvest.</p>
        <p>Around the world today, communities continue to celebrate with corn mazes, Oktoberfest beers, moon festivals, and All Saints’ customs echoes of age-old gratitude and remembrance.</p>

        <h2>Winter</h2>
        <p>Winter runs from December to February, bringing the shortest days and quiet landscapes in colder zones. Historically, it has been a time of solace and celebration, starting with Saturnalia, an ancient Roman festival turned upside-down feast preceding the winter solstice, which celebrated community and renewal. </p>
        <p>Across cultures, winter is rich with festivals of light; Dongzhi in China celebrates the return of longer days with family gatherings and symbolic foods. Celebrations like Christmas, Hanukkah, Yule, and Kwanzaa offer warmth and reconnect communities amidst dark days. These traditions reflect winter’s deeper symbolism; endings that promise new beginnings, comfort in community, and hope during the cold. </p>
